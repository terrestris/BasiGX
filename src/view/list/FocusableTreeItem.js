 *
 * * `BasiGX.view.list.FocusableTreeItem` instances can be focused; by clicking
 *   or by hitting the tab-key.
 * * If a focused treeitem receives a `keypress`-event that originates from
 *   either the space-bar or the the enter-key, the `selectionchange` event of
 *   the parent `Ext.list.Tree` is fired with the focused item passed as new
 *   selection
